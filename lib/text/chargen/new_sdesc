You will now be required to enter the short, or 'brief' description
of your character.  This is the phrase that other players will see when
your character speaks, moves, or issues a command. You should begin
this phrase with 'a' or 'an', in all lowercase, and it should not end
with any sort of puncutation, e.g. a period.
 
     Examples:     - a wild-haired, blue-eyed young woman
                     - a gaunt, stick-thin man with gray hair
