You will now be required to enter the long description of your character.
This is the text that other players will see when they look at a room
and you are in it. Incorporate the features you noted in your short
description. Be sure to start the description with 'A' or 'An',
and to end with a neutral statement, such as "is here.". Basically
take the short description and copy it here, then put A or An at the
beginning and "is here." at the end and you will be fine.

     Examples:     - A young, blue-eyed woman with wild hair lingers.
                    - An older man stands here, shakily, his features gaunt.
