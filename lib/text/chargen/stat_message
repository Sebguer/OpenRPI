At this point, you must decide the attributes at which you wish your
character to excel.  Choose carefully with a mind towards the ultimate
goal you wish your character to one day achieve.  The attributes which
are currently a part of the game are:
     str: Strength      - The physical strength of your character.
     dex: Dexterity     - The hand/eye coordination of your character.
     agi: Agility       - The natural agility of your character.
     con: Constitution  - The health and stamina of your character.
     wil: Willpower     - Your character's mental fortitude and faith.
     int: Intelligence  - Your character's reasoning and learning abilities.

For a list of skills and attributes to help you choose, visit:
http://www.atonementrpi.com and go to the site's "Resources" section.

Type the attributes by their three letter initials on one line, in
the order of power and preference you wish.  The first attribute will
be rolled the highest, the last will be rolled the lowest. You will
then have several bonus points added, so they may not come out in the
exact order you entered.

If you would prefer an average distribution of attributes, such that
all are average rather than some being high, some being low, and some
being medium, then just type #6average#0. Your attributes will then
only be slightly randomised. You will receive the same total attribute
points through either method.
