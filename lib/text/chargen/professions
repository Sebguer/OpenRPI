a profession for your character from the list below. Selecting a professions
is voluntary, and the profession chosen has no impact within the game itself: 
they simply select your skills and attributes for you, building reasonable
characters with a good selection of attributes and skills for those new to the game.

Any options set by selecting a profession can be changed before submitting
your final application, and if you do not wish to choose a profession, you
can simply select 0 and create your own custom character.
