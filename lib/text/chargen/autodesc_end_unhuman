You can now choose a few options to complete your character's
description:

#9#6  1#0#6. Using those features and idiosyncracies you've chosen,
create your own character description. However, your personal
description cannot contradict anything you have just picked.

If you had picked a generic eye colour, this is your
opportunity to place specific colouring.

For the purposes of creating a custom description, below are
the outputs of the particular mutations or cybernetic
replacements you picked - you should aim to work this text,
or something much like it, in to your customised description.

Please keep these to a reasonable level - mutations are the
sort of thing you might expect to find as birth defects, and
cybernetic replacements were for parts your character needed
to keep on living, not become a cyborg warrior. Your application
may be rejected if you go over the top with your description.#0

#9#6  2#0#6. Re-do from the start, picking everything afresh.#0
