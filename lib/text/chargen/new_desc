You now need to enter the 'physical' description of your character.
The description is required to be between four and ten full
lines in length and should not indicate how the character thinks or
feels. It must be as objective as possible; tell us how your character
LOOKS, not what other people may think about it. Please do not write in
the second person (i.e., no 'you see', 'before you', etc). Lastly, do not
mention any specific equipment or clothing that the character might be
wearing, as this will be displayed seperately once you are in the game.
Example:
      Standing tall and stick thin, this woman has a somewhat haunted
look with her brown, deep-set eyes and yellow-hued skin tone. A
lack of color has left her olive skin tone washed out, but despite her
jaundiced appearance, she actually seems quite sturdy. Her long
and tenuous limbs are steady, and her posture is upright. The hair
crowning her head is a rather mousy shade of brown, and it falls
quite straight and limp down to her shoulders.

When you are finished, enter the @ character of a new, blank line.
