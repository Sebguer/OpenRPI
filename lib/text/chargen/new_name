Atonement is a roleplay-intensive environment, in which in-character
behavior is mandatory at all times. As such, it is required that all PCs be
named in a fitting manner. This means that you should name your character
something that someone might realistically be named in real life. You may
always create an alias once you are in-game by using the command:
"SET KEYWORDS <ALIAS>".
   
As was mentioned during the account registration process, you are also
prohibited from using your login name for your character.
