Atonement RPI features a system that allows you to automatically
generate your character's description by selecting a nature of
generic and unique features regarding them. At the end of the
process, you are allowed to decide whether you wish to keep this
automated description, or craft your own personal description.
  
Many of the choices available are dependent upon your character's
age, sex, and attributes.
  
However, whether you accept the description or not, the features
you choose here will still have an in-game impact: for example,
other characters may determine the colour of your character's
eyes even if your character was masked.
  
You may restart the process at any time by typing #6REDO#0.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to go back to any other
point than the beginning, due to the way future choices are
dependent upon previous selections.

To begin with, which of the following descriptors best describes 
your character's height?
