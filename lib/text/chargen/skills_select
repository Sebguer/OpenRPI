Now, select the skills your character will begin the game with.
You can select between 4 to 8 skills, but the more skills you
select, the lower level they will begin. To select a skill,
type its name from the list below, e.g. "Education" or "Hide".
To deselect a skill, type its name once more. Some skills will
not become available until others are chosen.

You will notice that several skills have already been chosen
for you. These skills correspond to your selected profession,
but feel free to add more skills or remove the suggested ones.

Once in game, it is relatively easy to learn new skills by
attempting their linked activity, but difficult to raise them
to a proficient level without professional instruction. Choose
skills which correspond with your character's background and
concept, not ones which you think will grant your character
the greatest advantages.

If you wish to see more information about a skill, then type
#6help skill#0, where "skill" is the skill you want to know
more about.

NOTICE: Guns are rare in Atonement RPI. Choosing gun-based 
skills is allowed, but know that they will most likely not 
be a part of your fundamental experience within the game.
