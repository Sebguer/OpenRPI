Here are the final results of your choices regarding your character's
description: both the short and full forms of their description are
available. Depending how you feel on this description, you have one
of three choices:

#9#6  1#0#6. Re-do from the start, picking everything afresh.#0

#9#6  2#0#6. Using those features and idiosyncracies you've chosen,
create your own character description. However, your personal
description cannot contradict anything you have just picked.

If you had picked generic hair or eye colours, this is your
opportunity to place specific colouring.#0

#9#6  3#0#6. Accept the description generated automatically for
you, completing the process by picking your two most noticable
features.#0
