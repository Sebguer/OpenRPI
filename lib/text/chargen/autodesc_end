You can now choose a few options to complete your character's
description:

#9#6  1#0#6. Using those features and idiosyncracies you've chosen,
create your own character description. However, your personal
description cannot contradict anything you have just picked.

If you had picked a generic eye colour, this is your
opportunity to place specific colouring.#0

#9#6  2#0#6. Accept the description generated automatically for
you, choosing words to describe your height, build, and other
noticeable  features.#0

#9#6  3#0#6. Re-do from the start, picking everything afresh.#0
