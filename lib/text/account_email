A valid email address is required to authorise your account. Your first
password, a randomly assembled one that you can change later, will be
emailed to that address from our server. If you do not enter a valid
email address, then you will not receive the password to your account.

If you do not receive your password, be sure to check your spam or
junk mail filters. If you still have not received an email with
your password, then email staff@atonementrpi.com with the name
of your account and the email address you used for further assistance.
