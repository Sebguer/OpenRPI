While playing here at Atonement, we ask that you follow
our policies and rules: tinyurl.com/arpipolicy.

The two most important rules to know from the start are:
1. As a Role-Playing Intensive game, your character is expected to act in an
In-Character manner at all times; and
2. Only one active account per player is allowed - no multiplaying.

Refusing to follow either of these rules will lead to your access to the
game being revoked.
