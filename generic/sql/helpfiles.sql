A \nplayer, in theory, may learn any skill, and all skills only increase through \nactual use. As you get better at a skill, you may need to find more difficult \nchallenges to test the skill and increase it. \n   \n   In particular, advanced combat skills will be acquired at a much higher rate \nif you plunge your character in to real, and increasingly difficult, combat \nsituations. You will learn a lot more fighting whilst wounded against three \nfoes than you will using against a sole training partner wielding padded \nweapons. \n   \n   The rate that skills advance also depends upon your character\'s attributes. \nAll skills have a cap which, not surprisingly, is also determined by your \ncharacter\'s statistics. If you have reached this cap for a particular skill, \nthis skill will show in #3yellow#0 in your skills list. \n   \n   In general, the cap of skills that involve using your hands is determined \nprimarily by dexterity, while the cap for skills that involve using your mind \nis determined by intelligence. \n   \n   Your character also has a cap of the total amount of combined points they \ncan have in all skill. Once you reach this cap, the skill command will inform \nyou of such. Determined primarily by your intelligence, once your character \nhas reached this cap any additional skill gains made will come at the expense \nof an existing skill. You can control which skills are eligible to be deducted \nby using the #6focus#0 and #6ignore#0 commands. \n   \n   The level of skill proficiency is designated in nine levels: Beginner, \nNovice, Amateur, Familiar, Talented, Adroit, Master, Heroic and Legend. Skills \nthat you have at a particularly low level, typically ones you gain from \nlearning by doing, will not appear on your skill list until they each a certain \nthreshold, and will also not count towards your skill cap total. \n   \n   Skills can be learned either at character generation, from someone teaching \nyou via the #6teach#0 command, or by engaging in an action linked to the skill. \nWhen a skill is taught, it opens at a value that depends upon your character \nattributes as well as the person who teaches you.

INSERT INTO `helpfiles` (`name`,`category`,`entry`,`related_entries`,`required_level`,`last_changed`,`changed_by`) VALUES ('Shops','Building','\nThe following describes the procedure to build a shop:\n\n1) You must first have, at the very least, a mob initialized.\n   If you plan on having your shop within a room, i.e. stationary,\n   you should also have that room number initialized. You should\n   also know what sort of items your shop will buy and sell; food,\n   weapons, etc...\n\n2) Use the MSET KEEPER command to initialize the shopkeeper. If\n   this is not a newly created mob, you will probably want to\n   start editing it with MOB <vnum>. If the shop is a room, the\n   FLAG of the keeper should include Sentinel. Leave this flag out\n   if you wish to make a wandering merchant. For the sake of simplicity\n   you might want to consider making a mob with the same v-number as\n   the room his shop is located in.\n\n3) Next, RINIT the storeroom. A shop keeper does not keep his goods\n   in his inventory; all items are placed in the storeroom. ALL\n   storerooms should be located in zone 0.\n\n4) Now use the \"LOAD obj <obj vnum>\" inside your storeroom to place\n   the items for sale in your shopkeeper\'s listing. A shop should\n   generally not contain more than 6-7 items; this will provide the\n   player a decent amount of variety, while not giving him or her\n   access to too many items in one location. Now, when you type \"list\"\n   in the same room as your shopkeeper, you should see all the items\n   you just loaded into his storeroom.\n\n5) A shop can \"reproduce\" an unlimited supply of up to five items. This\n   adds a bit of \"reality\" to the game. If you were in a tavern, you\n   should be able to purchase more than one tankard of ale. The MSET\n   DELIVERY command allows you to specify which items you want your\n   shop to reproduce. Note: Some discretion should be used in specifying\n   which items will be reproduced. For example, it would be common for\n   a keeper to reproduce an unlimited supply of ale, but not for a\n   weapons-maker to reproduce the finest chainmail, or the best sword,\n   without limit. Therefore, do not set \"quality\", \"complex\", or \"unique\"\n   items with MSET DELIVERY.\n\n6) To set the types of items a shop will purchase from players, use the\n   MSET BUY command. Note: Some items should not be set with BUY --\n   trash, food, other, and note. However, setting these items to not be\n   bought with MSET NOBUY is a good idea.\n\n7) Another thing to set when making a shop is its buy and sell profit\n   values. The MSET DISC command sets the percent value that the keeper\n   will try to purchase the item for. Example: MSET DISC 0.75 would mean\n   that the shopkeeper would try to buy an item off the player at 75% of\n   its real value. Similarly, with MSET MARK 1.1, the keeper will try to\n   sell the item at 10% more than its cost.\n\n','(null)',1,'Sat May 14 00:08:53 2003','Traithe');

INSERT INTO `helpfiles` (`name`,`category`,`entry`,`related_entries`,`required_level`,`last_changed`,`changed_by`) VALUES ('Craft_branching','General','The Atonement craft branching system is an extremely powerful\nand versatile piece of code. Unlike other MU*s, where characters tend\nto progress along static, pre-determined paths, our system of craft\nbranching is entirely dynamic - that is to say, when your character\nbranches a craft what s/he learns next is determined by a number of\nfluid factors beyond merely which subcraft s/he just completed. These\nfactors include your character\'s skill level, their race, their clan\naffiliations and ranks, and finally any items that are either REQUIRED\nor PRODUCED by the subcraft you just completed.\n\nThe order of precedence in craft branching is down, then up. Think\nof it this way; in order to create complex and interesting items,\nyour character must first learn the fundamentals.\n\nFor an example, let us examine the #6cast bronze-sword-guards#0 craft.\n\nThese sword guards are used in the creation of a number of different\nitems, ranging from practice blades to real weapons. However, before\nwe can fashion full blades from them, we must first learn to create\nthe wax crossguard required by the sword-guards craft itself. Thus,\nthe first time we branch a subcraft after successfully crafting a \nsword-guard, we will be given the #6pour wax-crossguard#0 technique.\n\nAfter learning to pour a wax-crossguard, if we pass another branch\ncheck with the bronze-sword-guards craft, the code will automatically\nlook UP the tree at what crafts require what we just produced, since\nwe now have all the crafts to produce what sword-guards REQUIRES.\n\nIn this case, it would immediately catch upon an #6assemble sword#0\ncraft. However, we don\'t quite know how to make all the ingredients\nrequired to assemble any sword yet; specifically, we\'ll still need\nto be able to forge a bronze pommel before doing so. Therefore, the\nsubcraft we branch second will be #6cast bronze-pommel#0.\n\nWhen we pass a branching check for the third time, rather like we\npreviously learned to pour the wax crossguard model, this time we will\nlearn the #6pour wax-pommel#0 subcraft to round out our knowledge.\n\nNow that we know how to construct the lower part of the sword, we\'ll\nnaturally progress to learning how to forge a blade; therefore, our\nfourth successful branching check will bring us #6forge longsword-blade.#0\n\nFinally, we have the fundamentals! Namely, cast bronze-sword-guards,\npour wax-crossguard, cast bronze-pommel, pour wax-pommel, and forge\nlongsword-blade. Therefore, upon passing a branch check after using \nANY of these crafts, we will finally learn the \"crown jewel\", so to \nspeak: #6assemble longsword#0. Because our system is dynamic and\ntherefore intelligent in a way static progressions are not, it means\nthat no matter where you start along the \"tree\" of the #6assemble\nlongsword#0 craft, you will fill it out completely and eventually\nreach the apex. See the diagram below:\n\n                           #6assemble longsword#0\n                                    ^\n                                    |\n                          #6forge longsword-blade#0\n                                    ^\n                                    |\n              ----------------------------------------------\n              |                                            |\n   #6cast bronze-sword-guards#0                       #6cast bronze-pommel#0\n              ^                                            ^\n              |                                            |\n     #6pour wax-crossguard#0                            #6pour wax-pommel#0\n                                                            \nThe power of this system of branching lies in its dynamism and its\nfluidity. Thus, the branching path demonstrated above will not always\napply to all characters; depending upon which specific crafts they use \nin which order, and what their skill levels are, they may learn to forge\nshortswords first, or even practice blades. The only constant is that\nthe system will automatically search for any related crafts that you\nqualify to be assigned -before- it opens a random new craft for you.\n\nThe only circumstance in which you will branch an entirely unrelated\nsubcraft is if the system can find no subcrafts related to the one you\njust completed for which you qualify. The echo you receive when you\nactually branch a craft will inform you whether or not the new craft\nis related to what you just completed, or if it is entirely new.\n\nNote that even when the code assigns random, unrelated crafts, there\nare still requirements that those crafts may or may not have; thus,\nApprentices will not mysteriously branch Master-level crafts, Goblins\nwill not learn to make Elvish blades, and so on.\n\nFinally, please note that craft branching ONLY applies to other\nsubcrafts within the craft category of the subcraft you completed\nbefore passing your branch check. Therefore, weaponcraft subcrafts \nwill only branch into other weaponcraft subcrafts, hunting craft\nsubcrafts will only branch into other hunting craft subcrafts, etc.\n\nTherefore, to learn more subcrafts in a category, you must use the\nopening crafts you are given (those marked with an asterisk on the\nfull crafts listing on our website), and practice them diligently.\n\n','Crafts Teach',0,'Wed Nov  4 23:07:38 2009','Phoenix');

INSERT INTO `helpfiles` (`name`,`category`,`entry`,`related_entries`,`required_level`,`last_changed`,`changed_by`) VALUES ('Newbie','General','Hello, and welcome to Atonement RPI!\n\nThis helpfile is designed to list the basic commands you\'ll need\nto know while playing Atonement. While there are many more commands\nthan are listed here, these tips should hopefully be enough for a\nfirst-time player to get started.\n\n#6Movement#0\n\nNORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST - These are the basic movement commands, \nand can be abbreviated to N, S, E, and W. Using these will take \nyou to the next room in that direction. Movement is not \ninstantaneous like in other MUDS, but takes a little time, \ndepending on the speed you\'re moving. To change the speed of \nmovement, use the SET command, which will be discussed later.\n\nSIT, REST, SLEEP, STAND, WAKE - These commands are fairly self \nexplanatory. While sitting, your character is considered to be \nupright, and while resting, your character is assumed to be lying \ndown. You may use SIT, REST, and SLEEP with items in the game, \nfor example:\n\nsit chair\n\nwould make you sit on a chair, if one is present in the room. If \nthere is more than one piece of furniture in the room, you can \nsee a list of it by typing TABLES.\n\nThe STAND command has another use - it can be used to position \nyourself at the edge of a room, so you can easily LOOK into any \nadjacent room. To use it, STAND <direction>.\n\n#6Communication#0\n\nEMOTE - This command allows you to have your character perform \nan action. Anyone else in the room will see the specified action. \nFor example, if #5a bald, fat man#0 typed this:\n\nemote pretends to be a camel.\n\nthe rest of the room would see:\n\n#5A bald, fat man#0 pretends to be a camel.\n\nTo specify another player or item in an emote, use a tilde (for \nplayers or mobs) or asterisk (for items) before the player or \nitem\'s keyword. If #5a bald, fat man#0 is in a room with \n#5a thin, red-haired woman#0 and a #2heavy, iron anvil#0, and \ntypes:\n\nemote sits down on *anvil, shaking his head at ~woman.\n\nthe rest of the room would see:\n\n#5A bald, fat man#0 sits down on #2a heavy, iron anvil#0, shaking \nhis head at #5a thin, red-haired woman#0.\n\nSAY - The basic communication command, SAY lets you send a message \nto  the rest of the room. To precede the say with an emote, place \nthe emote in parenthesis before the message. #5A bald, fat man#0 \nmight type:\n\nsay (shaking his head) No, I don\'t like whiskey.\n\nand the rest of the room would see:\n\n#5A bald, fat man#0 says, shaking his head,\n   \"No, I don\'t like whiskey.\"\n\n\nTALK - If you are seated at a table, the TALK command will send a \nmessage only to those who are seated at the same table. Others in \nthe room, if skilled at listening, may overhear fragments of your \nconversation.\n\nTELL - The tell command is like SAY, but targets another player \nspecifically. Simply put the player\'s (or mob\'s) keyword before \nthe words to be spoken. The rest of the room WILL hear this message.\n\nWHISPER - The WHISPER command is like TELL, but sends a message \nto one other person ONLY, who you must target. For example, \n#5a bald, fat man#0 might type this:\n\nwhisper woman No, I don\'t like whiskey.\n\nThe woman would receive the message, while the rest of the room \nwould hear nothing (or receive only fragments).\n\nSHOUT - This command allows you shout, letting adjacent rooms \nhear your words. It works like SAY, but anyone in a nearby room \nwill be able to hear you (although they will not necessarily know\nwho is shouting).\n\nTHINK - The THINK command lets you think a private message, which \nonly the administrators can see.\n\nNOTIFY - You can use this command to notify entire clans or specific \npeople, letting them know you\'re online and looking for roleplay. \nConversely, you can also use this to respond to a notify sent to you,\nletting the notifier know you\'re online.\n\nPETITION - PETITION is an Out of Character method of communication \nwith the administrators. You may:\n\npetition all <message>\n\nto address all administrators online at the time, or\nto target a specific one:\n\npetition Traithe <message>\n\nMudmail - Accessible via option 8 from the account login menu, \nMudmails can be used to communicate with other players. It\'s a \ngreat way to contact clan leaders or people you need to speak with \nICly, and set up times to catch them online and RP.\n\n#6Information#0\n\nSCORE - SCORE shows you the statistics of your character;\nyour name, age, a rough estimate of your physical attributes,\nwhether you are hungry or thirsty, and other helpful things.\n\nCOUNT - This command searches through all the containers worn\non your person and counts up the coins you have. This takes a\nlittle bit of time to do, so be patient.\n\nINVENTORY, EQUIPMENT - These commands let you see what you\'re\nwearing and holding.\n\nTIME - This shows you the IC time and date, currently, in the game.\n\nWEATHER - If you are outside, this command gives you information\nabout the current weather.\n\nSEARCH - This command allows you to search a room for hidden\nobjects or players, and can also be used to search a direction for\nhidden exits. To do this, simply SEARCH <direction>.\n\nSKILLS - Shows you a list of the skills you currently know, and a\nrough estimate of how good you are at them.\n\n#6Manipulation#0\n\nGET - This will pick up an object in the room, or take an item from\na container. To do this, simply GET <item> or GET <item> <container>.\nRemember that you can only hold two items at a time, one in each\nhand.\n\nDROP, PUT - These commands are the opposite of GET, letting you\ndrop an item on the floor or put an item in a container. To put an\nitem into another, PUT <item> <container>.\n\nGIVE - GIVE allows you to pass an item from your possession to another\'s.\nTo use it, GIVE <item> <player>.\n\nOPEN, CLOSE - These commands allow you to open or close doors,\ngates, curtains, and the like. If there is more than one door in a\nroom, you can OPEN <door> <direction>. You may also have to open or\nclose certain containers.\n\nKNOCK - This allows you to knock on a door, letting anybody behind\nit know that someone\'s there. To use it, KNOCK <door> or\nKNOCK <door> <direction>.\n\nEAT, DRINK - Use these commands to eat or drink an item you\'re\nholding, or to take a drink from a nearby water source, such as a\nsink.\n\nFILL - Fill is used to fill a drink container from a water source. Simply\nFILL <container> <water source>.\n\nLIGHT - This command can be used to light a flashlight, lamp, or\nother light source. To extinguish the light source, LIGHT <item> off.\n\nWEAR, WIELD - These commands allow you to manipulate objects\nin your possession. WEAR will wear a piece of clothing or armor on the\nappropriate place, and WIELD will brandish a weapon.\n\nSWITCH - Switch simply moves what you\'re holding in your left hand\nto your right, and vice versa.\n\n','Chargen Commence Mentor ',0,'Wed Nov  4 23:07:38 2009','Phoenix');

If you didn\'t specify ANYTHING, it will return with the\r\ntotal number of entries currently in the system logs.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that we store our logs for indefinite periods of\r\ntime, in order to ensure reasonable results the command will\r\ndefault to a backdate of 14 days if you don\'t specify another\r\nperiod of time with the DAYS, HOURS, or MINUTES parameters.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, if you do not specify an alternate set of logs (e.g.\r\nthe guest or staff logs), the command defaults to PC logs.\r\n\r\n#6Available Search Parameters:#0\r\n\r\nport <port ##> : Allows you to specify the port number for which\r\nyou wish to search the logs. This value defaults to the port that\r\nyou\'re currently connected to. Possible values: 4500, 4501.\r\n\r\nplayer <name> : Allows you to specify a specific PC\'s name, so\r\nthat the only entries searched will be commands entered by them.\r\n\r\naccount <name> : The same as the PLAYER parameter above,\r\nexcept that it will search lines for any character on the account.\r\n\r\nnpc <name> : Searches only log entries generated by the named\r\nNPC; the output includes the name of the imm animating it.\r\n\r\ncommand <command> : Searches only log entries generated by\r\nthe specified command. Note that all commands are expanded\r\nby the parser before being logged - e.g. a \'command emote\' will\r\nturn up someone who enters \'emo does a little dance.\' Commands are\r\nstored in a separate field from their arguments to ensure that you \r\ncan, for example, search for the think command without turning \r\nup log lines like \'say I think I\'m a clueless moron.\'\r\n\r\nroom <room ##> : Only returns log entries generated in the\r\nspecified room.\r\n\r\nminutes <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the\r\nlast X minutes.\r\n\r\nhours <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the last\r\nX hours.\r\n\r\ndays <X> : Only searches log entries generated within the last\r\nX days.\r\n\r\nguest : Searches through the guest log for the specified terms.\r\n\r\nimmortal : Searches through the staff log for the specified terms.\r\nNote that only level 5 staff members can access this.\r\n\r\nsystem : Searches through the system log for the specified terms.\r\n\r\nerror : Searches through the system log for the specified terms,\r\nand will only return entries flagged as critical errors.\r\n\r\nascend : Normally, the output given by this command is sorted\r\nso that the newest entries are displayed first, and the oldest at\r\nthe bottom of the list. If you use the ASCEND parameter, this\r\norder is reversed, displaying the oldest entries at the top. It is\r\nparticularly useful if you need to retrieve a very old log entry;\r\nif you needed something from six months ago, you\'d use \'days\r\n180 ascend\', and the output from that period would be at the\r\ntop. If you didn\'t use the ASCEND parameter it\'d be at the bottom,\r\nand quite likely truncated off due to the sheer number of lines.\r\n\r\n#6Some Examples of Usage:#0\r\n\r\nlog (port 4500) traithe : Will search the player port records for\r\nany ENTRY containing the word \'traithe\'. Note that if you\'re using\r\nthis command from the player port you needn\'t specify \'port\' as\r\na parameter, and that this will NOT return Traithe\'s commands.\r\n\r\nlog (account thorongil hours 24) sew OR knit : This will search the\r\nlogs for whichever port you\'re currently on for any entries created\r\nwithin the last 24 hours by any PC on Thorongil\'s account for \r\neither the term \'sew\' or the term \'knit\'.\r\n\r\nlog (room 2014 command kill) : This will search the logs for any\r\nusage of the kill command (no matter how it was entered, whether\r\nkIlL, kil, ki, KILL, etc.) that occurred in room 2014.\r\n\r\nlog (guest) application AND sucks : Will search the guest logs on \r\nyour current port for any entries containing BOTH the word \r\n\'application\' AND the word \'sucks\'.\r\n\r\nlog (room 129 minutes 30 ascend) : Will search the player logs\r\non your current port for any entries generated within room 129\r\nwithin the last 30 minutes, and display them in ascending order.\r\n\r\n','(null)',4,'Thursday, 01:30:52 am, 28th October 2004','Traithe');

Pristine condition means that for an item to \nmeet your order, it must have no damage, and if the item has uses \nor charges, have none of these used. For each step down, it will \nbe the equivalent of a condition level down for weapons, armour, \nand clothing, such that \"fair\" condition will accept items in \nthat are \"worn\" or better, and so on.

For instance: \n\n#6order place 1 fair 1102 110 curved ! ! ! titon#0 \n\nWill mean that for my sword (item 1102), the first variable must \nbe curved, the fifth variable must be titon, but it doesn\'t \nmatter what the other variables are. \n\nWhen you place your order, you will leave enough cash to cover \nthe cost of the order with the merchant, in addition to whatever \nfees the merchant may decide to charge. \n\n#6FILLING AN ORDER#0 #6order fill <number> <item>#0 \n\nOnce an order has been placed, the first one to present an item \nthat matches the criteria will hand over their item, and receive \nthe chips stored away. #6order list#0 will display any \noutstanding orders, and then the #6order fill#0 command will \nallow you to fill one of these orders. If an item is marked as \nhaving detail, it means the person who placed the order has \nrequested specific variables that must be met by any object that \nhopes to fill the order.

Each neighbourhood \nis further broken down in to blocks - usually one block to each street-level \nroom. Each of family exists in a continual struggle to gain the loyalty of \nmore blocks, and more neighbourhods -- the more blocks loyal to a Family, the \nmore workers they can count upon to fill their factories and greenhouses. \n\nThe loyalty of any one block is determined by how much fear and how much love a \nFamily commands.

If the current-ruling Family is no longer the most feared and \nloved, then the block will become disputed. \n\nAdditionally, a Family\'s fear and love will slowly decay to its \"normal\" value \nevery 7 Real-Life Day Turn - the \"normal\" for a Family increases if it owns the \nblock, the neighbourhood, and a special block, the cultural centre of a \nneighbourhood, known as the Heart Block. \n\nThe loyalty of a neighbourhood is determined in a simpler fashion: whoever owns \nmore than fifty per cent of all the blocks in a neighbourhood can claim its \nloyalty. If no Family can claim this, then the loyalty is disputed. \n\nUse the #6turf#0 command to see what you can do on any particular piece of \nturf. Aside from the gossip command, these commands are used to increase \neither your Family\'s love or fear on a block. You need to be at least ranked a \nPrivate in a Family to be able to use these commands, and have at least three \npeople following you in a group. \n\nYou can only use these commands on a block already loyalty to your Family, or \non a block adjacent to one that is loyal. Using the commands will give your PC \na 12 Real-Life Hour timer. You won\'t be able to participate in another turf \naction until this timer lapses -- don\'t worry, it counts offline time for \nlapsing purposes. \n\nOnce you have your posse set up, and start one of the commands, you\'ll be set \nin the room for around 10 Real-Life minutes: use this time to roleplay exactly \nhow you\'re spreading your Family\'s name throughout the populace. You might \nroleplay harassing bystanders, or preaching the creed your Family believes in, \nor whatever you can imagine. If you get interrupted in this 10 minutes, then \nyou\'ll have to start again.

I.e. you can use \"reye\", \n\"lhip\", \"face\", etc. Coincidentally you can also make up your own one-word \nlocations, if need be. For instance you could do #6wound man 5 fire location crotch#0\nto do a \"small burn on the crotch\". \n#0\nIf you specify no location it will randomly choose one, using the same formula as \nit does during combat. \n#0\n[bleeding <bleeding>] is an optional field for you to specify specific bleeding \nfor a wound. Note that wounds -will- acquire bleeding on their own without this \naddition, just like normal wounds in combat, but if you use this it will override \nit to a specific amount. \n#0\n[infected] is an optional field that specifies that the wound will be infected. \n#0\n[lodged <lodged>] is an optional field that allows you to lodge an object in the \nwound.
