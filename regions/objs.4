a $camocolor1, $design3 marked, suit of banded body armour~
A $camocolor1, $design3 marked, suit of banded body armour rests here.~
   In addition to a multi layered jacket of $polymesh, numerous plates and 
bands of hardened, shaped polyprop have been fitted into inner and outer 
pockets of this suit of body armour, granting it both a banded appearance as 
well as superior protection from firearms. Thick sections composed entirely of 
this reinforced polyprop with a thin covering of dense polymesh are attached to 
the sides, bottom and top of this suit, providing protection to the shoulders, 
thighs, and neck. The polymesh has a $camocolor camouflage pattern. The front 
and back of the suit have been marked with a $color $design.

A scale-lined, $color, $jacketstyle jacket has been left here.~
   This jacket is $color-dyed and $jacketstyle. The exterior is 
fashioned from $polymesh, but this is merely a shell to contain 
the armour within, easily visible whenever the fabric is pulled 
tight against it. Numerous small, circular plates of a 
ceramic-like material, none bigger than a large coin, have been 
fused together in an overlapping configuration that draps over 
the shoulders and body, the density of the plates lessening the 
further the jacket reaches down the arm and on the rim about the 
neck.

a banded, $camocolor1 combat helm~
A banded, $camocolor1 combat helm is here.~
   Numerous layers of polymer-hardened $polymesh have been fused together to 
form this hardened combat helm before having being treated with some kind of 
strengthening resin and marked with a $camocolor camouflage pattern. The 
untreated polymesh interior allows the helmet to sit comfortably atop of one's 
head. In addition, numerous geometric bands of hardened plastic run across the 
helmet, adding additional strength and protection. When properly worn, the 
helmet covers the forehead before sloping down to conceal the ears and back of 
the head. A hard plastic chin strap dangles from the mesh.
